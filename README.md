- `Tkinter`
- `Requests`
- `API`
- `JSON`

## 🚀 Features

- Fetches quiz questions dynamically from an API
- True/False question format
- Interactive GUI with instant feedback
- Score tracking throughout the quiz
- Clean, focused interface for distraction-free play

## 📍 The Process

This project was originally created on **Day 17 of the 100 Days of Python Code** course while learning object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, methods, and object interaction.

On **Day 34**, the project was revisited and significantly improved using concepts learned in later days. The quiz data is no longer static and is now fetched dynamically from the Open Trivia DB API. This required working with API endpoints, making HTTP requests, and parsing JSON responses.

Additional improvements included unescaping HTML entities to properly format question text, introducing Python type hints for clearer data expectations, and integrating a Tkinter-based GUI to make the application fully interactive.
